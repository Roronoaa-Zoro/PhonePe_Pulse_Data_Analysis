# PhonePe_Pulse_Data_Analysis
The Phonepe Transaction and User Data Visualization project is a Python-based solution that extracts data from the Phonepe Pulse Github repository, transforms it using pandas and stores it in desktop as CSV file and then visualize it using Power BI 

For this project I have used the official phonepe data 

In this project I used the pandas library to web scraping the data by parse the json file and to do necessary Data Cleaning before converting those data to .csv format, After doing all the necessary steps I used those .csv file to make a Power BI Dashboard
